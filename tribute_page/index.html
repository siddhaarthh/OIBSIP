<h3>Here's a time line of Srinivasa Ramanujan's life:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>December 22, 1887 </strong> - Born in  Erode, Madras Presidency</li>
  <li><strong>1903 </strong>- he secured a scholarship to the University of Madras but lost it the following year because he neglected all other studies in pursuit of mathematics."</li>
  <li><strong>1909</strong>- he began a search for permanent employment that culminated in an interview with a government official, Ramachandra Rao."</li>
  <li><strong>1911</strong>- Ramanujan published the first of his papers in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society. </li>
  <li><strong>1913</strong>- he began a correspondence with the British mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy that led to a special scholarship from the University of Madras and a grant from Trinity College, Cambridge. </li>
  <li><strong>1914</strong>- Overcoming his religious objections, Ramanujan traveled to England in 1914, where Hardy tutored him and collaborated with him in some research.</li>
  
  <li><strong>1917</strong>- Ramanujan had contracted tuberculosis, but his condition improved sufficiently for him to return to India in 1919. </li>
</ul>

<i>"Ramanujan's life and achievement are:- Ramanujan left behind three notebooks and a sheaf of pages (also called the “lost notebook”) containing many unpublished results that mathematicians continued to verify long after his death."</i> <br><br>
